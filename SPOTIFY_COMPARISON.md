## ⚠️ Features Spotify Has That We DON'T Have

|---------|---------------------|
| **Audio Features** (energy, danceability, tempo, valence) | YouTube API doesn't provide this audio analysis data. This is Spotify's proprietary music analysis. |
| **Currently Playing** | YouTube Data API v3 doesn't support playback control or status |
| **Playback Control** (play/pause/skip) | YouTube Data API v3 is read-only for music data |
| **Recently Played History** | YouTube API has rate limits that make this challenging, plus it's more video-focused |
| **Top Tracks by Time Period** | Would require complex historical analysis not provided by YouTube API |

4. **Global Trends** - See what's popular worldwide

## 🏆 Verdict

**For most users, the YouTube Music Pack offers MORE features and MORE flexibility!**

The only significant gap is audio analysis features (energy, danceability, etc.), which are Spotify's proprietary data and can't be replicated. However, our pack makes up for this with:
- Trending insights
- Better recommendations
- Playlist analytics
- Larger music library
- Visual content access

**Bottom Line**: If you need audio feature analysis, use Spotify. For everything else, YouTube Music Pack is equal or better!
